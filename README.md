# parking_garage

The parking garage program allows users to simulate multiple customers entering, paying, and leaving a parking garage. 

This program was created in collaboration by Devin Dull and Billy Kantor using pair programming, in which both creators switched between physically
writting code and giving the other ideas/brainstorming solutions. This work was done simultainiously through the Live Share extension to VS Code.
